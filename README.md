## Technologies
- **Microsoft Excel:** Excel is utilized for data preparation tasks such as importing raw data, cleaning and transforming data, and performing preliminary analysis. It provides a familiar and versatile environment for handling structured data efficiently.

- **SQL:**  SQL was used for querying and validating data, ensuring accuracy and consistency throughout the analysis. It enabled efficient data extraction and transformation, laying a solid foundation for building the dashboard.
  
- **Tableau:** Tableau was the primary tool for creating interactive visualizations and dashboards. With its rich visualization options and dynamic filtering capabilities, Tableau allowed for an intuitive and engaging user experience, enabling users to explore and analyze CRM sales data in-depth.

## Approach 
- **Data Collection and Preparation:** Microsoft Excel was used to gather and prepare the raw data. This involved importing data from various sources, cleaning it to remove any inconsistencies, and transforming it into a structured format that could be easily analyzed.
Key steps included handling missing data, removing duplicates, and standardizing formats for consistency.

- **Data Validation and Querying:** SQL was employed for querying the data and ensuring its accuracy and integrity. This step involved writing complex queries to filter, aggregate, and transform the data to meet the needs of the analysis.
SQL also played a crucial role in validating the data, checking for inconsistencies, and performing calculations needed for the dashboard's metrics (e.g., total revenue, deal counts).

- **Building the Dashboard:** Tableau was utilized to create the interactive visualizations and dashboard. The prepared and validated data from SQL was connected to Tableau to create dynamic charts and graphs.
Key features such as drill-down capabilities, real-time insights, and filtering were incorporated to allow users to interact with the dashboard and analyze data based on different criteria, such as performance by manager, region, or product.
User Interaction and Insights:

The dashboard was designed to provide actionable insights through intuitive visualizations. Users can explore the data by filtering for specific managers, regions, or time periods.
The goal was to empower stakeholders to make informed decisions based on clear, real-time data insights.

- **Testing and Optimization:** Throughout the development process, the dashboard was tested for performance and accuracy. This involved reviewing the data flow from Excel to SQL and ensuring that the Tableau visualizations displayed the correct information.
Optimization steps were also taken to ensure the dashboard loaded efficiently, especially when handling large datasets.
